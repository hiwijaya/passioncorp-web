On September 12th, 2024, the ASEAN Vinyl Council (AVC) held its highly anticipated international conference, From Linear to Circular – Enhancing Resources in the PVC Value Chain, at Mövenpick Hotel Jakarta City Centre. This event, organized by Passion Corp Indonesia, brought together key stakeholders from various sectors, including representatives from the Ministry of Industry, academics, researchers, industry leaders, and recycling practitioners.

The primary goal of this conference was to raise awareness and deepen understanding of the PVC value chain, with a particular focus on the transition from a linear to a circular economy. By emphasizing sustainable practices, such as recycling and resource efficiency, this initiative aims to support government programs designed to enhance environmental sustainability in Indonesia.

## A Collaborative Effort to Drive Change

This conference aligned with national and international trends in circular economy practices and PVC recycling efforts. It provided a platform for productive dialogues between the government, AVC members, industry associations, recyclers, and other relevant stakeholders. By fostering these relationships, the event also contributed to strengthening ties between the PVC industry and government bodies in support of environmental regulations and sustainability targets.

The discussions underscored the importance of PVC recycling activities in Indonesia, showcasing how the value chain can contribute to national initiatives like reducing plastic waste and supporting the green economy. AVC members, including resin producers and additives suppliers, shared their self-imposed sustainability initiatives to ensure their operations align with circular economy principles.
