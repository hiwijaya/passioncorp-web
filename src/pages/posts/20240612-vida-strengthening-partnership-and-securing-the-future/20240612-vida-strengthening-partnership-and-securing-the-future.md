Passion Corp Indonesia had the honor of organizing the VIDA Partner Forum 2024: Fostering Growth by Securing Identity on June 12th, 2024, at the elegant Rasa Restaurant in Hotel AYANA Midplaza, Jakarta. This exclusive event brought together VIDA, Indonesia’s leading digital identity provider, and its valued partners, serving as both a networking platform and a show of appreciation to those who have collaborated with VIDA over the years.

The event was not just a time to reflect on partnerships; it was an opportunity to share cutting-edge innovations. VIDA is committed to elevating their solutions, enabling their partners to better serve clients by providing secure, reliable digital identity products in an era where data security has never been more crucial. As cyber threats continue to evolve, protecting personal and corporate identities is of the utmost importance.

The VIDA Partner Forum 2024 featured a lineup of prominent speakers who brought both vision and clarity to the conversation around digital identity and security. The discussions focused on how organizations today must not only embrace the digital transformation but also place significant emphasis on identity protection to prevent unauthorized access, identity theft, and other cybercrimes. As highlighted by VIDA’s leadership, securing private identities has become a vital aspect of business resilience.
