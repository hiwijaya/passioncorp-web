The ASEAN Vinyl Council (AVC) successfully hosted the AVC International Conference: From Linear to Circular – Enhancing Resources in the PVC Value Chain at Mövenpick Hotel Jakarta City Centre. This highly anticipated event, organized by Passion Corp Indonesia, brought together international participants to discuss key aspects of the circular economy, with a special focus on the PVC industry’s role in sustainability.

The event featured presentations addressing essential topics such as the role of PVC in sustainability, government regulations related to the circular economy, collaborative efforts between organizations, and innovations in PVC recycling technologies. This forum not only provided an opportunity to delve into the technical and regulatory aspects of the PVC value chain but also fostered connections among participants, making it a valuable networking platform for industry leaders, researchers, recyclers, and government officials.

The overarching theme of the conference, From Linear to Circular – Enhancing Resources in the PVC Value Chain, was divided into several important sub-themes. And beyond the educational aspect, this conference served as a premier networking opportunity for all attendees. Leaders from various sectors were able to exchange ideas, form partnerships, and explore new avenues of collaboration to advance sustainability goals.
