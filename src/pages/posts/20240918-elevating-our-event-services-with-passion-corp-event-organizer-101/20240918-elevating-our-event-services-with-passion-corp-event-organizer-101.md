On September 16th, 2024, we organized an exclusive internal training session called "Event Organizer 101" at the cozy Cerita Coffee Tebet. This initiative was designed to not only refine our team's expertise but also to strengthen our shared commitment to professional growth and innovation. At Passion Corp Indonesia, we are committed to delivering exceptional event services—and that starts with continuous learning and development. 

We were fortunate to have two outstanding trainers lead this program: Hary Awil, an event management guru, and Ari Yudha, a leading expert in LED systems. Their guidance provided our team with a deep understanding of both the technical and managerial aspects of event production. Hary Awil took us through the core principles of successful event management, including planning, coordination, and show management, while Ari Yudha introduced us to cutting-edge LED technology, essential for creating captivating visual experiences.

This training wasn’t just about learning new skills—it was about becoming more professional as a team. By enhancing our expertise, we can serve our clients better, ensuring that every event we handle is executed with precision, creativity, and care. But beyond skill development, this program allowed our team to strengthen relationships with each other, building stronger ties that will help us work more effectively in the future.
