On January 21st, 2024, Passion Corp Indonesia had the honor of organizing an exclusive event for We Clinic, a renowned plastic surgery clinic from Bangkok. The We Clinic Afternoon Tea Party, held at the prestigious Swissôtel Jakarta PIK Avenue, brought together guests for an intimate and elegant gathering to discuss the latest trends in rhinoplasty and explore opportunities for international partnerships.

With growing interest in rhinoplasty and other cosmetic procedures in Southeast Asia, the We Clinic Afternoon Tea Party served as a platform for discussing these trends in an exclusive, relaxed setting.
